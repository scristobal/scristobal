### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu (he/him). I learn to code in Turbo Pascal at 12. After graduation, I was doing maths for a while, and it was fun. Then I got into Data Science, and it was okish... but I am into Software Engineering, and I am having fun like never before!

I code a lot of stuff in the browser, with TypeScript and React/Redux. Also a big fan of Reactive programming and RxJS, I think Observables fit pretty well on user applications. I also code quite some backend, until now using Nodejs/TS, but I am transitioning to Scala and Go. 

Feel free to explore my profile and code, unfortunately most of the work I do is on private repositories. However, in my free time I develop open-source libraries to fill some gaps we need at work. Mostly in the TypeScript/nodejs ecosystem. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
