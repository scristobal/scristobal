### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu (he/him). I learnt to code in Turbo Pascal at 12. I did an engineering degree, followed by a second degree in maths and a MSc. I was doing maths in academia for a while, and it was fun. Then I got into Data Science, and it was ok... but I am into Software Engineering now, and I am having fun like never before!

Feel free to explore my profile and code, unfortunately most of the work I do is on private repositories. However, in my free time I develop open-source libraries to fill some gaps we need at work. Mostly in the TypeScript/nodejs ecosystem. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
