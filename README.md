👋🏻 welcome!! I hope you find something useful. 

Most of the code here is personal projects and random experiments. More "serious" code is in private repos.

- I open sourced some NPM packages, https://npmjs.com/~samuelsh
- I do not like social media, still this is my twitter https://twitter.com/TypeSamuel
- Single blog post, I am a developer not a writter https://dev.to/typesamuel
- Not really a homepage, just a stub https://scristobal.github.io/homepage/
- My profile at Manfred, I think they are doing a great job https://www.getmanfred.com/profile/samuel
