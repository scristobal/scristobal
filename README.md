### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu (he/him). I was doing maths for a while, and it was fun. Then I did Data Science, and it was fine. But I now enjoy Software Engineering like never before!

My favourite topics are: type theory; declarative, functional and reactive programming; OOP w/ composition vs prototypal inheritance and Futures/Promises. Always love to chat an learn about those, or maybe something new! please do reach out!

In my free time I develop open-source libraries to fill some gaps we need at work. Mostly in the TypeScript/nodejs ecosystem. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
