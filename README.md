### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu and love the challenge of building great UXs and intricate UIs for the web ðŸ‘€

My avourite language is TypeScript. On the frontend, I enjoy writing my apps using React & Redux (when it makes sense). For the backend I use Nodejs, GraphQL and the Prisma ORM, but most of my work involves streams, so I use RxJS, Kafkajs and SocketIO.

I follow a mix of declarative, functional and reactive programming style, from the safety of strongly typed language if possible. 

Most of my day-to-day work is stored in private repositories, but in my free time I develop open source libraries than then I use for work. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
