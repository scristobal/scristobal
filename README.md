### Hi there 👋

I am Samu (he/him). 

Back in the 90s, I wrote my first lines of Turbo Pascal when I was around 12. Few years later, I did an engineering degree, followed by a second degree in maths and a MSc where I focused on algebraic geometry and logic. Afterwards I jumped into the data mining and machine learning train for a while. A few years ago, I co-funded a startup and became CTO. In reallity, I spend most of my time writting code as a Software Engineer. I guess that closes the circle.

Feel free to explore my profile and code, most of the work I do is on private repositories. However, in my free time I develop open-source libraries to fill some gaps we need at work. Mostly in the TypeScript/nodejs ecosystem. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
