### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu and love the challenge of building great UXs and intricate UIs for the web ðŸ‘€

My avourite language is TypeScript. On the frontend, I enjoy writing my apps using React & Redux (when it makes sense). For the backend I use Nodejs, GraphQL and the Prisma ORM, but most of my work involves streams, so I use RxJS, Kafkajs and SocketIO.

I follow a mix of declarative, functional and reactive programming style, from the safety of strongly typed language if possible. 

At the moment, most of my work is stored in private repositories, so there is not much to show just yet. But maybe something pops up soon!
