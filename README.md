👋🏻 welcome!! I hope you find something useful. 

Most of the code here is personal projects and random experiments. More "serious" code is in private repos. 

If you are reeeally curious, here are some more links:
- I open sourced some NPM packages, https://npmjs.com/~samuelsh
- I do not like social media, still this is my twitter https://twitter.com/TypeSamuel
- Single blog post, I am a developer not a writter  https://Dev.to
- Not really a homepage, just a stub https://scristobal.github.io/homepage/
