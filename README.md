howdy!👋🏻 I am Samu (he/him). Feel free to explore my profile and code, hope you find something useful. 

I wrote some open-source tools, mostly in the TypeScript/nodejs ecosystem, and some experiments 🔬 in Go. You can find them here or published at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh. 

I am always open to contribute to new or existing projects, or just having a nice chat. Do no hesitate to reach out! 📫
