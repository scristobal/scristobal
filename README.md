### Hi there 👋

I am Samu and love the challenge of building entangled UIs 👀 and intricate backends for the 🕸️

Reach out to talk TypeScript, React, Redux, RxJS, Nodejs, Prisma, GraphQL, Kafkajs, SoketIO or declarative, functional and reactive programming. 

In love types and prototypal inheritance and Promises! 

In my free time I develop open-source libraries to fill some gaps we need at work. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
