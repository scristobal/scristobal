### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu. 

I work at DataBeacon.aero, a startup committed to disrupt the aviation industry, I also happen to have co-funded it.

I love the challenge of building great UXs and intrincate UIs.

Favourite language is TypeScript (browser and node), best DX ever, I think. 
I enjoy writting my apps using React & Redux (when it makes sense). 
Weapons of choice when dealing with databases are GraphQL and the Prisma ORM.
Most of my work involves streams, so I use RxJS, Kafka and SocketIO.

My stile mixes declarative, functional and reactive programing.

At the moment most of my work is stored in private repositories, so there is not much to show just yet. But maybe something pops up soon!
