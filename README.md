### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samu and love the challenge of building entangled UIs and intricate backends for the web ðŸ‘€

- TypeScript 
- React 
- Redux
- RxJS
- Nodejs
- Prisma
- GraphQL
- Kafkajs
- SoketIO

I follow a mix of declarative, functional and reactive programming style. Love types and prototypal inheritance and Promises! 

In my free time I develop open-source libraries to fill some gaps I need at work. You can find them here or at https://www.npmjs.com/~samuelsh
